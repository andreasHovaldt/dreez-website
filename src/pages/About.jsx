                        Hello! My name is Andreas, currently I am persuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering, with a focus on AI, Vision, and Sound.
                        I love learning new technical skills and concepts and have a deep interest in modern technology.
                        I am always seeking new and exciting ways and opportunities to apply my technical knowledge and skills to solve problems and make meaningful contributions to innovative projects. 
                        Most important of all, I cherish the opportunity to learn and grow from the experiences and challenges that come my way.
                    </p>
                    <p style={{fontSize:"16pt"}}>
                        My native language is Danish, but I am also fluent in English as well, having written multiple projects in English including my Bachelor's thesis.
                        Additionally, I have worked with both English speaking supervisors and group members for multiple semesters.
                    </p>
                    <p style={{fontSize:"16pt", fontStyle:"italic", fontWeight:"bold"}}>
                        I am currently looking for an internship position for the fall semester of 2025. 
                        I am open to opportunities in the field of AI, Vision, and Sound, but I am also open to other opportunities that can help me grow and develop as a computer engineer.
                    </p>
                    <p style={{fontSize:"16pt"}}>
                        In my free time I still have an interest in tech and automation, and I like to keep up with the latest trends and technologies.
                        I have also worked on a few personal projects, including a small 3D printed self-driving car and a simple home-monitoring system utilizing either an Arduino or Raspberry PI.
                        Right now I am exploring self-hosting multiple containerized services, like this personal website, an automated media-server, and game server hosting, all running natively on home server running Proxmox VE.
                        When I am not working on any projects, I like to spend my time with my friends and family, I love to go for hiking trips or going for a run, and of course I enjoy playing video games ðŸ˜‰.
